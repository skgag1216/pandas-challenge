Analysis:
I'm basing my final analysis of the school data on the last 3 dataframes where school spending per student, size, and type
were compared to the average of the students' grades.
First the dataframe comparing school spending per student and students' average grade performance - 
This particular dataframe has output that is the opposite of what I predicted.
As far as spending per student, according to the data the more money 
spent per student the lower the outcome of the grades. Schools spending less per student capita were performing better. 
This raises questions for the schools that are spending more per student. Where is the money going - is it being allocated to
the correct places for the students' benefit? Do measures need to be put in place to track this higher spending? Or do the 
schools that are spending more have a larger gap to get their students to a higher grade performance? 
Next, according to the dataframes for school size and grade performance - smaller schools are performing better. This is in
line with my predictions. Smaller schools can allocate more resources, time, and teachers per student. In turn the students
grade performance is higher. The larger schools probably do not have as many staff per student and resources and money are
stretched thinner to encompass a higher number of students.
Lastly, charter schools are performing better than the district schools. This raises questions that can be explored through
possibly creating more dataframes. Are the charter schools smaller than the district schools? Do the charter schools have a 
higher budget than the district schools?
